# CityLab Development Guidelines & Best Practices
- We write well-structured, semantic HTML and pay attention to accessibility
- We value proper documentation (At least in a README.md)
- Only strictly necessary comments are written in the code. The code should be self-explanatory.
- We clean our data and make it machine readable. If possible, we make it freely available for download.
- Our Git commits follow the conventional commits conventions. This allows us to generate changelogs among other things.
- Proprietary tools - what is allowed, what is not?
    - Basically, we do not accept deliverables that create a dependency on proprietary tools
    - For screen design we prefer **Sketch** over Figma, Adobe XD and similar tools.
    - If paid external tools/infrastructure are desired, they should be discussed with us (Eg. I want to use Affinity Designer or Heroku)
